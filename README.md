# ngenetzky-hassio-common

This git repository is tying together ngenetzkyâ€™s Hass.io building blocks
using git submodules. This repository was inspired by
[ypid-ansible-common](https://github.com/ypid/ypid-ansible-common).

## How it works

This repository mainly consists of git submodules pointing to the last version
of git repositories which ngenetzky has verified and tested.
